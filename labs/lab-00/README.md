# Lab 0 - Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
## Intended Audience
This lab is really intended for users who have no experience with Jupyter notebooks. If you have even a cursory understanding of how Jupyter notebooks are organized, you can probably skip this.

## Duration
This lab shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to complete.

## Running this lab
If you've followed the getting started steps, then you have everything you need to run this lab. Open a supported browser and point it to either http://localhost:8888/tree, or http://127.0.0.1/tree. The Jupyter console opens, and you should see three directories labeled as **lab-00**, **lab-01**, and **lab-02**. and navigate to [lab-00/Jupyter_Basics.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/lab-00/Jupyter_Basics.ipynb). Follow the lab step-by-step until you feel comfortable navigating and making changes to a Jupyter notebook.
