# Lab 2 - Advanced Spark
## Intended Audience
This lab is intended for users who have completed Lab 1. A level of comfort with the Spark API is assumed.

## Duration
Both Optimizing Spark, and Spark Streaming labs shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes each to complete.

## Running this lab
If you've followed the [getting started](https://github.com/johnrevans6/spark-walkthrough/blob/4a59d9e84fa1a4faad14229fe8a89d2ede177d47/GETTING_STARTED.md) steps, then you have everything you need to run this lab. Open a supported browser and point it to either http://localhost:8888/tree, or http://127.0.0.1/tree. The Jupyter console opens, and you should see three directories labeled as **lab-00**, **lab-01**, and **lab-02**. and navigate to[lab-02/2_1 Optimizing Spark.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/lab-02/2_1%20Optimizing%20Spark.ipynb). Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the lab. Once completed, navigate to [lab-02/2_2 Spark Streaming.ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/lab-02/2_2%20Spark%20Streaming.ipynb)
